# Java Concurrency Example
Just a Java Concurrecy Example with: ConcurrentLinkedQueue.

I also used: Jsoup, Log4j2 and Maven.

The program has one producer and 2 workers.

The producer populates a queue with image urls (thanks to Jsoup), the workers download them.

It isn't a scrapyng program just a test with ConcurrentLinkedQueue.
